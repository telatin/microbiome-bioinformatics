The [MRC CLIMB BIG DATA](https://www.climb.ac.uk)
project offers modern storage in the form of
**[S3 buckets](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/AWS-bucket)**,
an object storage introducede by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## The problem

Traditional volumes behaves like local hard disks, while AWS S3 buckets are usually operated in a different way.
Here we will see how to *mount* an AWS S3 bucket (provided by CLIMB BIG DATA) into a Linux machine (typically, a virtual machine).

## What to know

From the *Bryn* interface take note of:

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link attachments/climb/bryn-s3.png %})

* Your bucket name (2), something like `group-storage`
* Your Access Key (5), something like `OYXIA829VSHI3X9WE`
* Your Secret (5), something like `Q6Pr0chIsHereQ8rCR1B10KZa0s7kujiaKKu`
* Where to mount the bucket (an empty directory, which we will create from scratch)

## The solution

1) Install fuse

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fuse
```

2) Install [**rclone**](https://rclone.org/)
(you can download the binary from [here](https://rclone.org/downloads/))

```bash
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```

3) Configure rclone. Find where the configuration file is located with:

```bash
rclone config file
```
The output should be something like `/home/ubuntu/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`

4) Using an editor - we will use nano - to edit/create the file. The command to start the editing session is:

```bash
# Replace the filename with the output of the previous point!!!
nano /home/ubuntu/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

in the configuration file paste the following, changing the informations with your bucket name, access ID and secret (see *What you need to know*):

```text
[climb]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
access_key_id = <your-CLIMB-S3-access-key>
secret_access_key = <your-CLIMB-S3-secret-access-key>
endpoint = https://s3.climb.ac.uk
acl = private
```

5) Create a directory where to mount the bucket. 
For example `/group-data`:

```bash
# Replace "/group-data" with the desired location
sudo mkdir /group-data
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP  /group-data
```
6) Mount the bucket to the newly created directory:

```bash
# Replace "BUCKET-NAME" with your bucket name (2)
# Replace "/group-data" with the desired mounting point
rclone mount --daemon climb:BUCKET-NAME /group-data
 ```
