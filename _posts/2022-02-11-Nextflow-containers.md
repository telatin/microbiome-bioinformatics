## The problem


## The programme

* [A de novo assembly pipeline]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-02-11-Nextflow-denovo.md %}): we will design a simple workflow to assemble and annotate microbial genomes
* [Gathering the tools]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-02-11-Nextflow-containers.md %}): we will use Miniconda to gather our required tools, and generate Docker and Singularity containers manually (Nextflow can automate this step, but it's good to practice manually first)
* [First steps with Nextflow]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-02-11-Nextflow-first-steps.md %}): we will install Nextflow and run a couple of test scripts
* [The Denovo pipeline in Nextflow]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-02-11-Nextflow-DSL2.md %}): we will implement our pipeline in Nextflow
