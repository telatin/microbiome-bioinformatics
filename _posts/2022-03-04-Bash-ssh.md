> How to use SSH to connect to a remote server

We will do most of our bioinformatics analyses on a remote server,
so we need to know how to connect to it.
We can do it using our terminal emulator (and the `ssh` command),
or using a feature rich environment, like Visual Studio Code.

In general we need to know:

1. The **address** of the server (can be an IP, like *120.29.128.2*, or a domain name, like *server1.mycompany.com*)
2. Our **username** (the one we use to log in) on the remote machine, which can be different from the one we use on our local machine
3. An authentication key, which can be a 
   1. **password**, which we type every time we connect (not recommended), or a 
   2. **key file**, which is seamlessly sent to the remote machine and used to authenticate us (recommended)

## Our key file, and how to generate one

Authentication using a key file is the recommended way to connect to a remote server. We need to have two files:

1. Our private key, which we keep on our local machine and must be kept secret: it's the actual file that will act as a password to unlock the remote server
2. Our public key: this is the analogue of a lock, which recognises the key and allows us to unlock the remote server. We need to add this information on the remote server (only once), and this will allow us to authenticate ourselves using the private key.

To check if you already have a key file, check if you have a *.ssh* directory in your home:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If the output contains a file named *id_rsa* or *id_dsa*, you already have a key file. It's associated public key will be in a file with the same name, but with the extension *.pub* (e.g. *id_rsa.pub* or *id_dsa.pub*).

If you don't have a key file, you can generate one using the `ssh-keygen` command:

```bash
# When asked for a passphrase, you can leave
# it empty (just press enter)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

:warning: the command will offer you to add a passphrase (not necessary, and if you forget it the keyfile will be unusable), and the path where to store the files (you can leave the default, which is *~/.ssh/id_rsa*).

Now check the files in the *.ssh* directory again:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

you should see two new files: *id_rsa* and *id_rsa.pub*:

```text
-rw-------  1 telatin  seqfu  3381  9 Nov 08:55 /Users/telatin/.ssh/id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  1 telatin  seqfu   742  9 Nov 08:55 /Users/telatin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

:mag: Using `cat`, and `wc`, check how the private key and the public key are different. You will need to use the public key to add it to the remote server:
send it to the administrator of the server or paste it in the cloud interface.


## How to log in from a terminal

If you have a terminal emulator (e.g. using MacOS or Linux), just type:

```bash
ssh username@address
```

where *username* is your username on the remote server, and *address* is the address of the server (e.g. *server1.mycompany.com*).

If you have a password login, the password will be asked interactively. You will need to type it but :warning: you
will not see it on the screen (not even asterisks). Just type it and press enter.

If you have a key file, it will be sent transparently (assuming it's `~/.ssh/id_rsa`), and you will be logged in. If the keyfile
is on a different location, you will need to specify it:

```bash
# If your keyfile is in ~/.ssh/mykey
ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey username@address
```

After successfully logging in, you will see a different prompt: you are now effectively a different user on the remote server.
You will see, with *ls*, the files that are on your remote home, not the local files


## Using Visual Studio Code

You can use Visual Studio Code to connect to a remote server, and use it as a full featured environment. 

See [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)
on how to do this, but if you use Linux or MacOS it will be straightforward.

1. Install the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension
2. Click on the remote servers icon on the left bar, and click on the *+* button
3. Type the command you would issue like `ssh username@address` and save the connection

Now you can connect to the remote server, and use it as a full featured environment. You can open files, edit them, and save them on the remote server.
