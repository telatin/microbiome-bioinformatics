## What is MetaPhage

MetaPhage is a Nextflow pipeline for viromics analyses (under development, more info coming soon).

### A worked tutorial

MetaPhage comes with a [step-by-step tutorial](https://mattiapandolfovr.github.io/MetaPhage/tutorial)
that will guide the user through:

1. The installation of the package
2. The download of a demo dataset
3. The installation of the dependencies either using Miniconda or downloading a Singularity image
4. The generation of a configuration file
5. The execution of the pipeline

### Output report

:star: [Pipeline report]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link attachments/metaphage/demo/report/index.html %}): we will design a simple workflow to assemble and annotate microbial genomes
