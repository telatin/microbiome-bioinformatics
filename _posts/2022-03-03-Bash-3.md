> Redirection: how to save to a file the output from shell commands


### The standard output

When a program returns some output to the terminal, it's using a communication channel called *standard output*. 
For example, when we run `ls`, the output is printed on the terminal:

```bash
ls  -l ~/learn_bash/README.md  
```

will return:
```text
-rw-r--r--  1 telatin  seqfu   58962 26 Oct 12:30 /home/telatin/learn_bash/README.md 
```

### Redirecting the output

![Redirecting the output]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/bash/redirection.png %})

We can redirect the output of a program to a file, using the `>` character. 
For example, to save the output of `ls` to a file, we can do:

```bash
ls  -l ~/learn_bash/README.md  > ls_output.txt
```

If we hit "Enter", we won't see any output on the terminal, and we will get our
prompt back. But if we look at the file `ls_output.txt`, we will see the output
of `ls`.

### The standard error

If we try this command:

```bash
# Here we feed to ls both an existing file and a non-existing file
ls -l ~/learn_bash-2022/phage/vir_genomic.fna /a/path/notfound.txt > ls_output_2.txt
```

We will see that the output of `ls` is saved in the file `ls_output_2.txt`, but
we will also see an error message on the terminal:

```text
ls: /a/path/notfound.txt: No such file or directory
```

How is this possible? Why are wee seeing some text if we did redirect the output?
There are two communication channels in the terminal: the standard output and the
standard error. The standard output is used to return the output of a program to
the terminal. The standard error is used to return other messages (including errors).

If we want to redirect the standard error to a file, we can use the `2>` character:

```bash
# Here we feed to ls both an existing file and a non-existing file
ls -l ~/learn_bash/README.md  /a/path/notfound.txt 2> ls_output_2.log
```
In this case we *will* see the README.md file listed, but the error is now silenced.
This is because it was actually redirected to `ls_output_2.log` (check with `cat`!).

You can redirect *both* the standard output and the standard error to the same file,
as summarised in this vignette:

![Redirecting the standard error]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/bash/redirection2.png %})

## :warning: Beware of overwriting files

If you redirect the output of a program to a file that already exists, the file
will be overwritten.
It's less intutive but this also applies when you try to redirect the output from a file to the
file itself. For example, if you try to run:

```bash
head longfile.txt  > longfile.txt
```

You would expect to see the first lines of the file `longfile.txt` saved in the same file,
but because the redirection will occur before executing *head*, the resulting file would be
empty!

### Appending to a file

If you want to append the output of a program to an existing file, you can use the `>>` character,
and this also applies to the standard error:

```bash
ls -l ~/learn_bash/README.md   > some_output.txt
ls -l ~/learn_bash/README.md   >> some_output.txt
ls -l ~/learn_bash/README.md   >> some_output.txt
```

The first command creates a new file called *some_output.txt* and saves the output of `ls` in it,
the following commands will append the output of `ls` to the same file. The resulting file will
contain three times the output of `ls`.

Similarily, if you want to redirect the standard error to a file, you can use the `2>>` character:

```bash
ls -l ~/learn_bash/README.md  /a/path/notfound.txt 2>  ls_output_2.log
ls -l ~/learn_bash/README.md  /a/path/notfound.txt 2>> ls_output_2.log
```

## Discarding the output

In linux [everything is a file](https://www.howtogeek.com/117939/htg-explains-what-everything-is-a-file-means-on-linux/),
meaning that in our filesystems we have files representing devices, processes, sockets, etc.
There are special files representing our printer, or even the speakers of our computer.

A special device is called `/dev/null`, and it's a file that discards everything that is written to it.

If you want to run a command but are not interested in the output, you can redirect it to `/dev/null`, or you can
suppress the warnings/errors redirecting the *standard error*  (`2> /dev/null`).
