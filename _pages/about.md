# Welcome to Microbiome Binfies


Some notes and tutorials for microbiologists interested in bioinformatics.
I started organising content for various workshop in this page to allow for easier sharing
of common contents, and because I liked the layout more than GitHub wikis (my previous
choice for handsout).

Found typos? :package: [repository](https://github.com/telatin/microbiome-bioinformatics)
